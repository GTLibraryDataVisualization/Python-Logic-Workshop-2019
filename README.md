# Python Logic

This workship will be the process behind writing a basic file parser. The goal will be to read in a file, parse the data, and write out a file with our cleaned data as a CSV file, as well as to print some statistics about our program's runtime to console.

Before we get started, theres a few areas of python to discuss

### Packages

One of the biggest strengths of python is the number of packages that have been written for it. **Packages** are tools that other people have written that can be used in our own code.

Packages are easy to install, if you're using Anaconda, most of the popular packages are already there for you to use. If you installed python from the official site, then we need to use **pip**, python's official package manager to install them accessed from the terminal. (not a python file or the python interactive prompt)
